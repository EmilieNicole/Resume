    <h2>► READING</h2>
    <p>
      Reading is definitely one of my most favorite past times. I wasn't into
      reading for a very long time. The last time I got into a really good book
      that I absolutely couldn't put down, I was in highschool reading the
      Twilight series with my best friend at the time. Sadly, I wasn't able to
      finish the series due to my parents religious beliefs and being forbidden
      from reading the rest. Today, as an adult, I own the box set and several
      special editions of the Twilight series! No shame!

    <h2>► Video Games</h2>
    <p>
      Video games is another favorite hobby of mine. My primary gaming platforms
      are PC, Steam Deck, and Nintendo Switch. I love sandbox games the most
      where I am able to build things, explore, and befriend creatures. Ark
      Survival Evolved, Pal World, Pokemon, Stardew Valley, Ooblets, and Animal
      Crossing are a few of my absolute favorite games of all time!

    <h2>► Web Development</h2>
    <p>
      Web development is actually one of my favorite hobbies! I have my own
      website which is a more personal project, and due to my anonymity on it
      I'd prefer not to share it here. But I can say that it is made with
      Wordpress, and it is a small web project I feel really passionate about.
      The small web has become a sort of niche where people make their own
      personal creative website just for fun! They are often have elements of
      nostalgia from Web 1.0 (think early Myspace era, Geocities, etc) when the
      web wasn't so commercialized and people used the web more for fun rather
      than business. This era was a time when the internet had a lot more soul
      and human spirit. So the small web, in a nutshell, is a movement of people
      who want to bring that back, putting people and creativity over profits.
      This is one of my favorite geeky past times!

    <h2>► Beach Combing</h2>
    <p>
      During the summer when the weather is warmer, I love going to the beach
      and looking for sea treasures, such as sea glass, shells, hag stones, and
      pretty rocks. You never know what kind of treasures you might find!
    </p>

    <h2>► DIY</h2>
    <p>
      Last but not least, I absolutely LOVE DIY projects and crafting. I make
      jewelry, crochet, occasionally sew, and just love creative projects. I
      think this is why web development is perfect for me as a professional
      career, because I'm a builder, and I love being creative; whether it be
      making crafts with my hands or graphic design, or building entire
      websites. I thrive in projects where I get to be creative and use my
      imagination.
