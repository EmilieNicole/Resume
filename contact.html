      <p>
        Ideally, if you were to contact me, this is where I would have the
        information to do that. But sadly, I don't have that information
        available right now. But thank you for checking out my contact page
        anyways! Perhaps at the end of my web development course, I will come
        back here and update this with an email address or some other way to be
        able to contact me. In the meantime, thanks for stopping by and checking
        out my portfolio project!
      </p>
